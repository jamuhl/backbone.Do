# Introduction

Project goal emit a msg via socket to server and call a optional callback on response coresponding the msg.id.

# Usage

Just init the Backbone.Do.Hub and emit a message.

## INITIALIZATION

To configure Backbone.Do you got to init the `Backbone.Do.hub`.

	// you can go with defaults
	Backbone.Do.hub.init();


## MESSAGE HANDLING

### send message

To send message just:

    var do = new Backbone.Do.Req({
        id: '123456'
        // your content
    });

    // emit it
    do.emit();

### observe response

if you want to react on messages in respond you can:

    var do = new Backbone.Do.Req({
        id: '123456'
        // your content
    });

    // emit it and observe
    do.emit(function(res) {
        // do something
    });

or:

    // observe it
    do.observe(function(res) {
    	// do something
    });

    // emit it
    do.emit();

By default backbone.Do will look for a field `commandId` in the event. You can 
override this value or provide a own function to get the commandId in which the event 
was send as response:

	Backbone.CQRS.hub.init({

        requesrId: 'reqId', // override with another value

        // override the getCommandId function
        getRequestId: function(res) {
            return res.reqId.substring(0, res.indexOf('.')); // or whatever
        }
	});
